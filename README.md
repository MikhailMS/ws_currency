# Development
1. Setup Python virtual environment - I used conda in this project.
2. If you use conda as well, then you can use `conda_env.yml` file to bring the correct environment right up -> `conda env create -f conda_env.yml`
3. Install all dependencies once you activated new virtual environment -> `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Start developing

# Testing
1. To run tests -> `pytest tests/test_app.py`
